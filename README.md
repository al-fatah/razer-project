# Docker + Nginx Load Balanced Web App Deployment

This project demonstrates how to:
- Set up a **private Docker registry** with **S3 backend storage**
- Deploy the `yeasy/simple-web` container using that private registry
- Configure **Nginx as a reverse proxy**
- Configure **Nginx as a load balancer** to distribute traffic across multiple containers
